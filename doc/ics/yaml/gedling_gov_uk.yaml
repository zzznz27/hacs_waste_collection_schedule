   - Gedling Borough Council does not provide bin collections in the iCal calendar format directly.
   - The iCal calendar files have been generated from the official printed calendars and hosted on GitHub for use.
   - Find your collection weekday and schedule by entering your street name in the [collection search tool](https://www.gbcbincalendars.co.uk/collection-search).
   - The correct calendar link will be displayed. On the calendar page use the "Copy iCal URL" button to get the calendar URL to use with this integration.
